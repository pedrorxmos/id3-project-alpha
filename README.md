Project Alpha: About Me 

#

It is necessary to install node modiles when cloning the repository, for that use `npm install` on the terminal when the repository is cloned.

#

This project uses SCSS, so its necessary to use `npm run sass` on the terminal to compile the .scssc file:
> It only compiles the file `style.scss` inside of `scss` folder, if a different scss file is not imported inside, then it will not appear on the final css
